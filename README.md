## User Experience and Interaction

#### How the user will find out how to intereact with each feature

Once the user has entered their username and pin, they will be welcomed to the application with a menu of options to pick from. Each menu option is linked to a specific feature. 

#### How the user will interact with and use each feature


#### How errors will be handled and displayed to the user

THe application will utilise conditional loops along with rescues to hanfle errors. If the user is to enter an invalid username, pin or menu option they will be presented with an error message. The application will loop back to the option prior to the error to again ask for the user input. 

The app has also been developed through Test Driven Development to ensure errors are accounted for before run time.
